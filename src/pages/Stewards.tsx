We pride ourselves on our ability to train community members using real world equipment, providing them with valuable hands on experience. This proves to be valuable to our community members who wouldnâ€™t normally have access to networking equipment or server computers, but can experiment and learn with these technologies. This is an opportunity open to everyone, no prior knowledge required. "
