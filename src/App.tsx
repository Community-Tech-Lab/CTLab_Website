    "Back in late 2021 a partnership formed between Community Tech New York (CTNY) and El Puente. As a result of this, a handful of El Puente staff were trained by CTNY taking part in their Digital Stewardship Program. That training included a complete crash course intro to their PNK project, as well as The Detroit Digital Justice Principals that would go on to influence El Puente's involvement and push for Digital Equity. This lab is the first initiative to come of the partnership between the two organizations. It's purpose being to further their efforts to combat digital inequality within Black and Brown communities by providing a space in which people can come through learn the ins and outs of everyday technologies that are otherwise foreign to them. What sets this initiative apart from similar spaces in New York City, is that participants dont just sit in on lectures or workshops, they gain valuable hands on experience with proper equipment. Networking tools such as servers, antennas, routers, etc. We hope to empower people through the Digital Steward program and the use of the CTNY's own PNKs as teaching tools. ";

  const stewProgText: string =
    "This is the main program offered here at the Community Tech Lab. Facilitated by El Puente Staff and CTNY staff trained to help introduce community members to the fundementals of computer networking. Everything from configuring routers, to setting up linux server. All culminating in the stewards deploying Portable Network Kits with the understanding of how to troubleshoot and configure the equipment themselves.";

    "The Community Tech Lab is a hands-on tech and digital equity learning space located at El Puenteâ€™s flagship Leadership Center in South Williamsburg.  The first of its kind in NYC, the Lab launched in January 2023 through a partnership between CTNY and El Puente and in collaboration with the communities it serves.";
  const pnkText: string =
    "The portable network kit is first and foremost a teaching too. Created by CTNY, It is a kit made using easily accesible hardware with the goal to teach people how to set up and maintain their own personal networks. It also serves as a disaster prevention device if built correctly. Allowing for people to communicate and share information without the need to connect to the internet.";
